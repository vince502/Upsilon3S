These belong to Ref. [1], see  Fig. 3  for the p_T-dependence of R_AA (1S) up to 20 GeV/c. 
Fig. 13 in [2] (2020) shows the same 2017-calculation up to 30 GeV/c as in the tables,
to emphasise the rise at larger p_T.

The centrality dependence in the tables is as in [1],  Fig. 6 (centrality dep. of 1S)
of Ref. [1]; unbinned results for 1S and 2S from the same 2017 calculation
are shown in Fig. 14 of [2], I had included that figure in my talk. We did not show Y(3S) in a figure
since there were no data at that time, but is in the attached tables.

The three tables give results for the Y(1S, 2S, 3S)-states, but 1P, 2P, 3P are included
in the calculations, see additional table fyi. The notions “pre-cascade suppression factors”  
or “preliminary suppression factors” indicate the
in-medium suppression through screening, damping and gluodissociation (e.g.,
dashed curves in Fig. 14 of  [2]), whereas “final suppression factors” include the effect
of reduced feed-down, solid curves in Fig. 14. As discussed, your data show somewhat more 
suppression for the 2S in peripheral collisions than our prediction, and it will be interesting to
see how your new 3S data compare with the old prediction. Although a lot of progress
has meanwhile been made by other groups, I have not expanded or improved our model since 2017 for
symmetric systems, but instead used it to account for the hot-medium effects in asymmetric systems 
(p-Pb, see my talk in Torino, and [2]).
